The board was successfully implemented in the private room for the study.

Here is an image of the completed board:

The board was created using Acro spacers for the eye tracking glasses to track and measure precisely where the eye of the participant was currently looking at. They are 165 different markers, arranged row-ascending wise, starting at the index 0 to the index of 164.

The spacers were printed out and cut carefully for taping them to the white board.

In order to create the grid for the spacers to be placed on, I measured 11 rows with the spacers 9 cm apart and 15 columns with the spacers 9 cm apart. Each spacer is a 9 cm square.

Once the grid was completed, I attached each spacer to the board on each point of the grid using tape. After each spacer was spaced, I carefully erased the remaining grid markings. See the above image for the end result.

I started working on the board on Thursday June 7th, 2018. I finished the board on Friday June 8th, 2018.
