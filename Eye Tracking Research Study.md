Background
----------

In Dr. Parnin’s lab, I will be working on projects pertaining to measuring the cognitive load on programmers during technical interview settings. 

For more information pertaining to a previous study conducted on this topic, refer to this research paper:
http://chrisparnin.me/pdf/Dazed.pdf


In order to do this, we will need to find ways to associate how we measure “cognitive load” as well as its effect on performance of the programmer. To explore this topic, we will need to integrate sensors when collecting data on participants as well as categorizing simple versus complex tasks done on the whiteboard by the interviewee. 


Questions
---------

How does simple coding output problems versus complex tasks such as writing pseudo code chunks affect the cognitive load of the participant’s eye tracking and biometric data during a technical interview setting? 

Does the participant being monitored affect the cognitive load of the participant?
